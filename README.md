# NeurAlzheimer Project

NeurAlzheimer leverages Deep Learning techniques to detect the stages of Alzheimer's disease using MRI brain images in NiFTI format.
This project focuses on pre-processing medical imaging data, extracting meaningful features, and training models to classify the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories and files:

```
neuralzheimer/
│
├── src/
│   └── create_env.py
│   ├── data_manager.py
│   ├── feature_extractor.py
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── model_trainer.py
│   └── preprocessor.py
|
├── config.ini
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

- **`config.ini`**: Contains configuration settings for environment paths and data classifications.
- **`src/create_env.py`**: Sets up environment configurations and paths.
- **`src/data_manager.py`**: Handles data extraction from zip files and conversion from DICOM to NIfTI formats.
- **`src/feature_extractor.py`**: Defines methods to compute features from processed images.
- **`src/main.py`**: Main execution script to handle data pre-processing and model training.
- **`src/model_trainer.py`**: Contains classes and methods for building and training the CNN model.
- **`src/preprocessor.py`**: Pre-processes MRI images through various stages including normalization, registration, and skull stripping.

## Usage

1. **Data Pre-processing and Feature Extraction:**

   The main processing steps include skull stripping, alignment, registration, and normalization of MRI images. Execute `src/main.py` to run these processes and extract features for model training.

2. **Model Training and Classification:**

   Train a neural network model using extracted features and segmented MRI images to classify Alzheimer's disease stages.
